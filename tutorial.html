				<p>Here we examine some amusing Javascript.</p>
				<article id="tutorialArticle">
					<h3>Functions as shortcuts</h3>
					
					<pre class="brush: js">
						/* helper function for getting elements by Id */
						var $ = function(Id) {
								return document.getElementById(Id);
							}
					</pre>
					
					<p>I don't know exactly why I think this is so cool, especially since it's about the most simple
					thing one can do with Javascript.  But I do.  It might be that I always thought that "$" was some kind of magic
					symbol JQuery provided-- I didn't realize that Javascript also let me define "$" in a way that is useful to me.
					</p>
					<p>So when I call something like <span class="highlight">$('foo')</span> that acts as a shortcut for the long-winded document.getElementById()
						method, it just gives me code monkey warm fuzzies all over the place.  I know, I need to get out more.</p>
						<p>But I digress.  The way it works is you define a function that wraps some functionality, using "$" as the
							function name, instead of something more verbose:</p>
							<pre class="brush: js">
								var $ = function() {
										// do something useful...
										return "baz!";
									}
									
									/*  call our useful function... */
									var foo = $();
									alert(foo); // displays "baz!"
							</pre>
							<p>And that's it.  to use this shortcut, just call the <span class="highlight">$()</span> function and soak up the 
								concise goodness.</p>
				<h3>Javascript has Objects!</h3>
				<p>Before this class, I had a vague awareness that Javascript was some kind of object-oriented language. 
					Nothing I ever worked on, however, exploited this capability (with the possible exception of 
					JSON processing, and objects that I worked with without really thinking about their OOP nature).</p>
					<p>But Javascript does indeed have Objects, and they do all kinds of Objecty things.  Which now that I 
						think about it explains how people can write these insane 
						Javascript apps like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodejs" target="_blank">Node.js</a>.  It gives me hope that
						my Javascript future will be filled with OOPy goodness.</p>
						<p>Anyway, the thing that I like the most about objects is how simple they are to create and use.  Objects are
							classless  in Javascript, which to a C# guy is somewhat perverted, but the concept seems to work even if
							I don't entirely have my head wrapped around it.  To create an object is simplicity itself:</p>
							<pre class="brush: js">
								var cat = {}; // creates a cat object
								</pre>
								<p>You can (and usually do) get a little fancier:</p>
								<pre class="brush: js">
									var cat = {
										name: "Fluffy",
										color: "orange" 
										disposition: "cranky"
										}; // creates a cat object
									</pre>
									<p>having created an object you can access its properties:</p>
									<pre class="brush: js">
										alert(cat.name + ' is colored ' + cat.color); // displays 'Fluffy is colored orange'
										</pre>
										<p>Totally simple and easy. It only gets better from there.  Everything in Javascript is an object, apparently.
											even functions are objects, for god's sake.  Methods are objects.  It all gets very 
											weird for somebody who is used to more conventional OOP languages like C#.  But thanks to this
											class I am now aware of the rich hidden world of Javascript and am looking forward
											to diving deeper.</p>
											<p>Not much of a tutorial, but I'm assuming that the point is to demonstrate that I at least
												partially paid attention in the course, and that I have enough wits about me to 
												successfully use a 3rd-party library.  So signing off now.  Thanks for a great course!</p>
